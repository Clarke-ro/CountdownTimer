 Prompt 1: Project Overview & Setup
"I want to build a one-page online timer website. It should include a countdown timer, stopwatch, and alarm clock. The site must be clean, fast, mobile-responsive, and optimized for high traffic. It will be monetized through ads and sponsorships. Start by creating the basic website setup with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Keep everything simple and structured for easy updates. Use the Replit free tier for now."

üß± Prompt 2: Webpage Layout & Content
"Design a single-page layout with three main sections: a countdown timer, a stopwatch, and an alarm clock. Add a header at the top with the site title 'Online Timer' and a brief tagline like 'Free Countdown, Stopwatch, and Alarm Clock Tool'. Add SEO-friendly meta tags with a clear description and relevant keywords about timers and productivity. Use TailwindCSS for styling through CDN. Place simple, clean UI components for each timer function. Add two ad placeholder areas: one for banner ads and one for sponsored brand content. Add a footer with copyright, privacy, and terms."

üé® Prompt 3: Styling and Responsiveness
"Style the webpage with user-friendly, mobile-responsive design. Use large readable fonts for all timer displays. Buttons should have smooth hover effects and clear colors. Make sure the layout adjusts nicely on both desktop and mobile devices. Accessibility and usability are top priorities."

üß† Prompt 4: Timer Logic
"Implement the main functionalities using JavaScript. The countdown timer should let users enter minutes, start the countdown, and reset it, showing time in MM:SS format. The stopwatch should be able to start, pause, and reset, showing time in HH:MM:SS. The alarm should allow setting a specific time, and when the time is reached, it should play a sound and show an alert. Include input validation and user-friendly feedback."

üí∞ Prompt 5: Ad & Sponsorship Integration
"Add code sections where ad scripts like Google AdSense can be added in the future. For now, just include a console log saying 'Ad goes here'. Also, leave space for sponsorship banners from brands like productivity tools (e.g., Notion). The site should be ready to apply for monetization once traffic exceeds 10,000 monthly visitors."

üîç Prompt 6: SEO and Monetization Strategy
"Make the site SEO-ready. Target keywords like 'online timer', 'free stopwatch', and 'alarm clock tool'. Add a privacy policy and terms of service page placeholders for ad compliance. Add a simple contact method (email) in the footer for sponsorship or partnership inquiries."

üöÄ Prompt 7: Testing and Deployment
"Test the site in desktop and mobile view to ensure all features work as expected. Prepare it for deployment either through Replit hosting or a custom domain. Add Google Analytics to monitor traffic and session times. Optimize for long visit durations and low bounce rate."

üìö Prompt 8: Project Documentation
"Create a README that explains what the project is, its key features (countdown, stopwatch, alarm, responsive design, SEO, ads), how to set it up, and how it plans to earn revenue. List future improvements like preset timers (e.g., Pomodoro) and lead capture for newsletters or user engagement."
